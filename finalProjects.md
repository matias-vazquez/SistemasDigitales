# Laboratory of Digital Systems - Final Project

## Project Proposal
Write a formal project proposal that details the project you will to develop throughout the four weeks comprising from May 6 to June 3, 2021. Include in your document the following sections:

1. Overview
    - Describe in one paragraph what you would like to develop as a final project in general terms. 
    - Breakdown your project from general terms into specific tasks to be accomplished as a process, to carry out the overall purpose of your project.
    - Include a block diagram of the process to be followed (tasks) to accomplish the general purpose of the project.
2. Motivation
    - Explain how your proposed project contributes by adding value to solve an specific problem in a community (_e.g.,_ improving learning process of children in the classroom, protecting the elder from a particular disease, teaching braille reading to blind people, etc.). 
3. Work plan
    - Draw an __schematic diagram__ of the proposed system, including the Nexys 4 DDR board and external hardware, as required by your application. Show thw wiring and pin names for each of the external devices attached to the Nexys board. 
    - Also, include a __Gantt diagram__, considering:
        - 8 hands-on sessions, 1.5 hours long each (May 6 to June 3)
        - Project responsabilities for each team member (all team members must contribute developing code for the project)
        - A 10 minutes final presentation (June 7) including a 5 minute project explanation and 5 minute live demonstration. 
4. Modules
    - Describe in detail each of the tasks (or Modules) considered from Section 1, that will be part of your overall system. Include a description of their main function, and input and output ports, and the team member in charge of coding the module. 

## Hardware requirements
The minimum hardware requirements that your integrated system must fulfill are the following:
1. __Nexys 4 DDR Board with Artix-7 FPGA__, with at least three of the following resources:
    - 7-segment display
    - Push buttons
    - Slide switches
    - LEDs (standard or RGB)

2. __16x2 LCD display or 640x480 VGA display__ for real-time data display
3. __Two external input/output peripherals and/or sensor/actuators,__ such as
    - Temperature sensor
    - Real time clock
    - SD card
    - GPS module
    - Infrared sensor
    - 4x4 Keypad
    - Touch sensor
    - Servo motor
    - Relay
    - Other as suggested...
